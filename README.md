# About #
WiFi is a wireless network status monitor applet for the ROX Desktop.

Originally created by Cyrille Mars (http://www.m4rs.org) but seems to be abandoned, so I revived it here.

WiFi is a panel applet that displays an icon to represent the current wireless status/signal strength.  There are several themes for this display (including a rather silly Emotes theme using the Tango emotes icons).

Additionally, it shows more detailed statistics in a tooltip.  Currently it has no ability to change any network settings (TODO?).

The applet is entirely written in python using gtk.
