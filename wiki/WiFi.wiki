#summary The ROX WiFi Home Page.

= Introduction =

WiFi is a wireless status monitor applet for the ROX Desktop.


= Details =

WiFi is a panel applet that displays an icon to represent the current wireless status/signal strength.  There are several themes for this display (including a rather silly Emotes theme using the Tango emotes icons).

Additionally, it shows more detailed statistics in a tooltip.  Currently it has no ability to change any network settings.

The applet is entirely written in python using gtk.

= To Do ==
* Show IP Address and other details in the tooltip
* Allow the user to modify wireless settings.
* Make this a ROX front-end to NetworkManager???
