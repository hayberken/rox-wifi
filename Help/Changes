It seems that Cyrille is not supporting this anymore (it is missing from his site)
So, I put this release together. (Ken Hayber)

* Fixed menu positioning
* Added translation support for strings
* Added Tango and (feeling silly) Emotes themes (from NetworkManager and Tango projects)
* Updated to latest findrox.py
* Changed AppRun to inform use that this is an Applet and show Options
